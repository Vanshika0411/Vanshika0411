## ⚡ Fun fact:
I once built a chatbot for my personal website just to automate my social interactions! 😄
Did you know? The first computer virus, "Creeper," was created in the 1970s and was designed as an experiment to see if a program could spread between computers. It was harmless and just displayed the message: "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" 😄
